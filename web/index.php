<p>4DQC is a quality control software package aimed at imprioving laboratory medicine efficiencies and
lowering costs related to mass spectrometry (MS).
4DQC's web-based software suite for reference/clinical laboratories saves time on manual quality control (QC) processes 
and gives laboratory personnel and physician's insight into the overall health of their laboratory operations
leading to better business decisions in regards to quality. Preliminary estimates support a 90+ % reduction in labor costs associated with
repetitive manual QC processes not to mention extending routine, scheduled maintenance intervals with
data driven, condition based maintenance operations.</p>

<p>Key aspects include:</p.>

<h2>Incorporation of Instrument Maintenance for Data Driven Quality Investigations:</h2>

<p>4DQC accesses historical instrument maintenance records, reviews any instrument maintenance completed, problems found 
and whether or not they were resolved. 4DQC identifies instruments having problems, which problems occurred the most and when those
problems occurred. 4DQC can review real-time metrics regarding instrument maintenance (e.g., number of times a part has been replaced this month
and lost revenue from instrument downtimes).
</p>

<h2>Validation of Patient Test Results and Incorporation of Troubleshooting Guides:</h2>
<p>4DQC facilitates rapid solution convergence: Quick QC test results by monitoring unique quality metrics
such as ion suppression and sequential carryover in a matter of seconds. The web-based SW product
provides flexibility to easily customize the QC parameters to match how instrument set up matches test
performance to identify any potential incidents that might occur. 4DQC users can view historical test results
and review any QC conducted on test results, problems found and how they were resolved. In short, 4DQC trends patient 
test results to enhance quality assessment, provides automatic troubleshooting guides and accesses historical records 
to review the trouble shooting steps taken to resolve an incident and relevant details of the event; real-time 
metrics regarding lab performance, troubleshooting and incident resolution.
